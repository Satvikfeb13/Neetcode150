# 📘 NeetCode 150 – My DSA Problem-Solving Journey

Welcome to my **NeetCode 150** progress tracker!  
The goal of this repository is to **build strong logic**, sharpen **problem-solving skills**, and prepare for real-world **software engineering interviews**.

This journey helps me master:

- 🧠 **Logic building**
- 🧩 **Pattern recognition**
- 🏎️ **Fast problem-solving**
- 💡 **Optimal solution thinking**
- 🔍 **Debugging mindset**
- 💼 **Interview-ready coding skills**

## 🚀 Why NeetCode 150?

NeetCode 150 is the most efficient roadmap to learn DSA because:

- Covers all **core** interview topics  
- Problems are in **increasing difficulty order**  
- Helps build intuition and patterns  
- Stretch problems for confidence boosting  
- Most FAANG companies ask variations of these variations

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

### **1️⃣ Understand, Don’t Memorize**
- Understand input/output  
- Think brute force  
- Optimize  
- Identify patterns  

### **2️⃣ Practice → Review → Repeat**
- First attempt → brute force  
- Second attempt → optimize  
- Third attempt → code from memory  

### **3️⃣ Build Pattern Knowledge**
Common patterns:
- Sliding window  
- Two pointers  
- Binary search  
- Monotonic stack  
- Backtracking  
- DP patterns  

---

## 🏆 Goals

- Solve **150 problems**  
- Build strong **DSA intuition**  
- Improve **coding speed & accuracy**  
- Boost interview confidence
